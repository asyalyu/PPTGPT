# PPTGPT

This is an application prototype that automates the slides creation process for foreign professors by thus reducing the time presentation preparation takes from 3-4 hours to less than 5 minutes.

The creating_slides_with_working_code.py file takes care of creating a google slides presentation in a users Google Drive and making calls to ChatGPT via an API (using the davinci-003 engine) to generate information on the slides about words inputted by the user.

This code also uses a chat-based interface for users to select a language, desired output complexity, and words they want the slides to contain.
